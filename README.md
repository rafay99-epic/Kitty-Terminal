# Introduction:

Today we are changing the working of the application, giving user more choice and changing the structure for future versions and more features.

# Improvement:

In this version of the application we are giving user more choice to customize the terminal, make application more flexible and reliable. We are changing a lot code to make the application more beautiful and awesome. 

## 1. Shell choice:

From this version the application will ask the user to choose the shell they want. The shell can be from the following choice.

1. Fish Shell
2. ZSH shell 

These shell are supported for now more shell will be supported in the near future. 

## 2. Spitting Shell Repo:

Before this update we have created two main repo called the FIsh-Shell and ZSH-Shell. You can check these repo on the rafay99-epic GitHub. The purpose was that when the user choose the shell that repo will be cloned on your system, Once cloned then that repo install script will executed and the setting of that shell be done.

## 3. Reboot Ask:

Once all of the task are done the script will be suggest the user for reboot option. The user can choose yes or no. Yes to reboot the system, No to exit the application.

### 4. Moving Application:

In this update we are moving a couple of application installment from one repo to another repo. Before this update all of the application installment and shell configuration was done in the kitty terminal but not any more the two repos [Fish-Shell](https://github.com/rafay99-epic/Fish-Shell)  and [ZSH-Shell](https://github.com/rafay99-epic/ZSH-Shell) will handle the different applications installment and shell configuration. 

Only one application will be installed in the Kitty Terminal that is ‘kitty Terminal’

**Application Install:**

These application will be installed by the [Fish-Shell](https://github.com/rafay99-epic/Fish-Shell) repo or the [ZSH-Shell](https://github.com/rafay99-epic/ZSH-Shell) Repo
